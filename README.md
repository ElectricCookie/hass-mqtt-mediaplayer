*NOTES:

 * vol_payload: the component will replace the part of the payload specified with VOL_VAL with the proper value. For example, if your media player expects a payload in the format  of ```{"command": "volume_set","args": {"volume": "0.78"}}``` you must enter it in your configuration.yaml like the example above: ```"{\"command\":\"volume_set\", \"args\":{\"volume\":\"VOL_VAL\"}}"``` (escaping all necessary quotes)
 * status_keyword: This is the keyword your player publishes when it is PLAYING. You only need to mention the keyword for playing. For example, my player indicates it is playing by publishing ```playing = true``` to my broker. Therefore I enter ```"true"``` in my configuration.yaml
 * vol_up/vol_down: Setting this disables the volume_set service. Use vol_up/vol_down if your media player doesn't publish a volume level (i.e if your media player only responds to simple "volumeup"/"volumedown" commands. **If you use vol_topic & vol_payload DONT use vol_up/vol_down. Same for the reverse**
 
 
 
## Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
media_player:  
  - platform: mqtt-mediaplayer
    name: "Musicbee"
    topic:
      song_title: "musicbee/songtitle"
      song_artist: "musicbee/artist"
      song_album: "musicbee/album"
      song_volume: "musicbee/volume"
      album_art: "musicbee/albumart"
      player_status: "musicbee/playing"
    volume:
      vol_topic: "musicbee/command"
      vol_payload: "{\"command\":\"volume_set\", \"args\":{\"volume\":\"VOL_VAL\"}}"
    status_keyword: "true"
    next:
      service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: "musicbee/command"
        payload: "{\"command\": \"next\"}"
    previous:
      service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: "musicbee/command"
        payload: "{\"command\": \"previous\"}"
    play:
      service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: "musicbee/command"
        payload: "{\"command\": \"play\"}"
    pause:
      service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: "musicbee/command"
        payload: "{\"command\": \"pause\"}"

```

## Example MQTT Broker

This is what my player outputs and what I see when I use MQTT Explorer

```
musicbee
	playing = true
	songtitle = Repeat After Me (Interlude)
	artist = The Weeknd
	volume = 86
	album = After Hours
	command = {"command": "next"}
	albumart = /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABI ...
```
